# ListTheseServersBot
A Discord bot acting as a client for ListTheseServers


### Getting setup
* First, you will need to download Node.JS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Second, you will need to create a bot. Visit https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
* Create a new application, and after that, create a new bot from the side navigation.
* Copy the token in the new bot-app, and throw it into `settings.js` (after copying `settings.template.js` and renaming it as `settings.js`).
* In the project directory, run `npm install` to install all node dependencies.


### Starting the bot
To start the bot, simply execute `npm run test` from within the project directory.


### **Note**
Do not reveal any bot token in `settings.js`, if you are updating this file temporarily hide the bot token.

### Warning
Project is currently going through a restructure. Development has been halted for the time being.
